 ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose

   This code should be used for Project 3, unidirectional or bidirectional
   data transfer protocols from A to B and B to A.
   Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
     are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
     or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets may be delivered out of order.

   Compile as gcc -g project3.c student3.c -o p3
